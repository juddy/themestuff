This is an Alpha set of the itomatOS icons, Volume 2.

I'm looking for feedback on this one; bad contrast, wonky shadows (I know there are a few),
bad icons, etc.

There are a few icons (txt & iso among them) that have the filetype badge and a mini-icon
over the top. I need opinions on whether this is overkill, especially from people using 64 and 128px icons.

48, 64, and 128 px icons have been included this time around, and they will be in the final release.

Thx,
itomato
